Preferred Superpower: Life-Granting, she can imbue whatever she touches with life for various effects. It can be used in more abstract
						situations, like with electronics. She can also cancel the effect.

Superpower Weaknesses: The bigger the object, the more energy it consumes. The effect can last between 5 and 30 minutes, but can be bypassed
						if the object can be self-sustaining. Corpses won't bypass this rule. She can't affect herself without a roundabout method.
