{0} is used when a target variable is asked upon, e.g., the guides name. (If you want a specific thing to call upon, let me know so I can ensure that I code it in.)

Actual Dialogue:
Can have any Identifier for the dialogue itself, ex. StandardDialogue, DipshitDialogue, MagicManDialogue, but it's still best to label it based on what it is for

		StandardDialogue2: Dang, I'm kind of bored just walking around a house. What if we went on an adventure?
